=========
手机关机或信号不好时，有人给您打电话，开机后运营商给您发一条短信。
短信中写着给您来电的号码 ——到底是谁？

此应用帮您查看漏接电话短信中的联系人与时间。短信发来也会显示系统通知。

目前支持三大运营商的以下格式的短信：  
联通：  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- "联通秘书在12:34为您接待了一位访客18645678901"  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- "尊敬的用户您好: 联通漏话提示服务提醒您18645678901于2015年01月02日03时04分联系过您"  
电信：  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- "18945678901在01月02日03时04分呼叫过您的手机"  
移动：  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- "中国移动(地区)公司来电提醒:13845678901于01月02日03时04分呼叫过您"    

For China Telecom, Mobile, and Unicom carrier customers in China.  
On these carriers, When your phone is not connected and someone calls you, the carrier sends a message to your phone saying when and who called you. However, the message only displays the phone number of caller, not their contact info.  
This app displays the missed call contact info and time, and makes it very easy to call or text back. It also displays a notification whenever such a message arrives, such as after being on a long flight and turning on your phone.
