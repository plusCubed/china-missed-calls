# China Missed Calls
For China Telecom, Mobile, and Unicom carrier customers in China (not endorsed or developed with the carriers). 

When your phone is off or not connected to the network, and someone calls you, the carrier sends a message to your phone saying when and who called you. However, the message only displays the phone number of the person who called you, not their contact info. 

This app displays the missed call contact info and time, and makes it very easy to call or text back. It also displays a notification whenever such a message arrives, such as after being on a long flight and turning on your phone.

手机关机或信号不好时，有人给您打电话，开机后运营商给您发一条短信。
短信中写着给您来电的号码 ——到底是谁？

此应用帮您查看漏接电话短信中的联系人与时间。短信发来也会显示系统通知。

目前支持三大运营商的以下格式的短信：
联通：“联通秘书在（12:34）为您接待了一位访客（123 4567 8901）”
电信：“（123 4567 8901）在（01月02日03时04分）呼叫过您的手机”
移动：“中国移动（北京）公司来电提醒:（123 4567 8901）于（01月02日03时04分）呼叫过您”
