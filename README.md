# China Missed Calls
For China Telecom, Mobile, and Unicom carrier customers in China (not endorsed or developed with the carriers). 

When your phone is off or not connected to the network, and someone calls you, the carrier sends a message to your phone saying when and who called you. However, the message only displays the phone number of the person who called you, not their contact info. 

This app displays the missed call contact info and time, and makes it very easy to call or text back. It also displays a notification whenever such a message arrives, such as after being on a long flight and turning on your phone.
